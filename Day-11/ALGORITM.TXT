=================== DUTCH NATIONAL FALG ALGORITHM =============================
steps:
    1. initilize 3 pointers ( l, m, h) ( l=0, m=0, h=n-1)
    2. take arr[m] and compare if it is 1 
        increment the m value
    3. if it is 0 
         swap wit l and m and increment the m, l
    4. if it is 2 swap with m and h
         and decrement the h value
    5. 

====================== collection framework ============================
=> three types:
    1. list
        arraylist, linkedlist, vector
    2. set
        hashset, linkedhashset, treeset
    3. map
        hashmap, linkedhashmap, treemap

these are interfaces list, map and tree 
rest of the all terms are classes 
=> interface contains incomplete methods , and class contain complete methods
=> list is ordered , ehich can allow dublicates
=> set is unordered which dont accept dublicates
=> maps contains key , value pairs

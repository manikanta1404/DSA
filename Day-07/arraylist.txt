=> array having fixed size , once we declare we cant change thhe size
=> to increage array size dynamically we have to use arraylist, its belongs to collection framework
=>what is a framework?
=> framework is nothing but, predefined methods  and will guide the program
syntax: List <Wraper class> array_name = new ArrayList<>();
ex: ArrayList <Integer> array_name = new ArrayList<>();

"List" is an interface and interface contains incomplete methods
"wraper class" its not a premitive data type its a class and in collections we have to use wraper class only 
=> "<>" is called generics 
=> "ArrayList" is call class, class contains complete methods
=> arraylist in a dynamicc if my array is 2  if i am trying to add 3rd element the size will be double and it will copy previous elements, visevarsa
the array will become half

=>as array list is a class u have to impot the arraylist class , now we can access all the predefined methods which consists in arraylist

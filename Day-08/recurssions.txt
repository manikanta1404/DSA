=> function call itself still its meets base condition  
=> there are two types in recurssion
    1. function calling same function itself and itself
    2.function calling another funtion itself and itself still it meets base condition
=> if we didnt mention base condition properly we get an exception called stack over flow
=>Recurssions  are used to break the code 
q. write code for factorial using recurssion
    5! = 5*4!
        4!= 4*3!
            3!=3*2!
                2!=2*1!

=> for ever recursive call elements will be push into stack after reaching base condition elements will be pop 
=> for our question 5,4,3,2,1,0 all these values will be push into a stack
psuedo code
fun(n){
    if(n==0){
        return 1;
    }
    else{
        return n*fact(n-1);
    }
}

=> fibnociss
psuedo code
fib(n){
    if(n<2){
        return n;
    }
    else{
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
    }
}

======================= pass wau value and pass way reference =======================

=>in java  we dont have pointers so we cant use references so java is pass value well

q. reverse an array using two pointers

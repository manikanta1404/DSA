subArray :- it contains in a sequence and should not reverse
subset :- no matter in sequence , but should not reverse the array 
subsequence :- it contains in a sequence and should not reverse in a string
subString :- no matter in sequence , but should not reverse the String 




======================================== greedy algorithm =================================
=> n- meetings in a room 
=> job sheduling
=> 0/1 fractional knapsack problem

=> q.1 n-meetings
 steps:-
    1. create a pairs using start and end time 
    2. sort the pairs using comparator according to the question ( by end time)
    3. check the end time with next meeting start time strictilly increase return and update the end time with current meeting
        (startTime.currentMeeting < endTime.nextMeeting)
    4. return the pairs or number of pairs

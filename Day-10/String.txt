 ====================================== Strings ===========================================
 
 => strings are classes, and arrays are objects 
 => the sequence of charecters is called strings
 => strings are immutable( cant be change )
 => all the array objects will be created in heap memory, but strings are inside heap memory inside string pool
 => once a string got created it will be created fixed it means we cant modify the string 
example:
    String a = "hello";
    String b = "hello";
    print(a==b)
    => these two lines are created hello in string pool and the two variables are pointing same in the same memory and it will print true

    String a = new String("hello");
    String b = new String("hello");
    print(a==b)
    => here created two objects in different  memory location and print false


    => this "==" compares address location in Strings
    => print(a.equals(b))
    => this will compare the data in that variables


=> q. print all subsets in an given array
================= sub set =======================

=> for a given an array we have to prit possible arrays it should be in a sequence but not continuous is called subset 
=> in an array if we have a n number of elements will get 2^n subsets



====================================  backtracking ====================================

=> its an example 

=> in recurssion we have only two possiblities 
    1.  (if and else)

in backtracking we have multiple possiblities,  most of the problems when ever we reach base case we have to print all base case elements 
=> remove last elements in every recurssive call

================== recurssion ==========================
q. from a given string we have to remove a charecter using recurssion
=> assume that we have starting with two strings input and output, at initial was empty we have few steps those are 
    1.take the first charecter from the string and store in a charecter variable
    2.check the variable with our target charecter , if it matches just return output string, elase append the charecter to the out[ut string
    3. slice the string by 1 charecter 
=> when ever input string becomes empty we have to stop the recurssive


=> if we have a particular charecter from a string we have to use charAt(i)
=> if we want to slice a string we have to use subString(ex:1)
=> isEmpty() is also a predefined function in Strings ( checks if string is empty or not )

q. from a given a string skip a word entire and print rest of the charecters
q. from the given string we have to skip "he" 







======================= Strings ===============================
=> in the memory strings are stored 
    => reference variable stored in stack
    => value is stored in the heap inside String pool

q. strings are immutable ( not change their value )
    => in the string pool we cant add or remove the valueof string after defining or declaring, but we can assign new string to the reference
    => and it will change the value to new string, and  before value will be pushed in to the barbage collector automatically


======================== Arrays ======================================
two pointer problem==================:
steps
    1. initilize the pointer( variable ) accoeding to the question
    2.if we are starting first pointer ( with 0 th index) , second pointer at last index , when ever both pointers cross eachother break the loop
    3.before breaking the loop do the relevant operation 

q. reverse an array using two pointers
steps 
    1.

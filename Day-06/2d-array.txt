=================== 2d-array ===============================
=> 2d array consistes of rows and columns 
syntax:
int[][] arr = new int[rows][columns];
=> the column numbers are optional
=> stack consists rows and heap stored columns
=> while declaring the array, we have to declare number of rows and column numbers are ( optional )
=> each row will act as a individual array

coding example or Q's
q1.array is sorted or not
q2.check target value in ana given array
q3.segregation 0's and 1's ( left 0's and right 1's)
Q4. find the missing number in an sorted array
q5.find zig-zag in an array
q6. maximum segregation 0's and 1's
    example: {1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1}-->here we get 3 1's then we need to print instead of that only 3





task rotate the 2d array in 90 deg
